    <p class="WIP">We are sorry to inform you that this website is nowhere near fully completed. It is still in the development stage, so don't worry about the gobbledygook below. You will find that links will not work, pages will not load, etc. We plan to get this site up and running ASAP, but until then, check us out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cresspresso-Entertainment-1288038001217335/">Facebook</a>!</p>

		<h3>Website Development Status</h3>
		<p class="date">20 Dec 2016, 15:55</p>
	</div>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The website is live at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">https://cresspresso.github.io{{ site.baseurl }}</a></li>

		<li>All of the articles/posts on this website are just for layout-testing purposes, and carry no real meaning, apart from this one.</li>

		<li>Codeblocks, for the <a href="/coding/">Coding</a> page, are looking beautiful. Download links for the script files work on Chrome (and I assume Firefox).</li>
			
		<li>Header and Footer navigation menus and links work as intended.</li>
		
		<li>The <a href="/music/">Music</a> page has embedded music tracks from SoundCloud.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Soon to come</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href="/gaming/">Gaming</a> page will have embedded videos.</li>
		
		<li>The <i>Social Sites</i> list will be expanded to include all my profiles on various sites, sub-categorised for my different pages (Music, Gaming, etc).</li>
		
		<li>The <a href="/about/">About</a> and <a href="/contact/">Contact</a> pages will be filled with information and links.</li>
	</ul>
